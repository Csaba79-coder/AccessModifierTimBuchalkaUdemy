= Good to know: Access modifier

1. public -> visible to all classes everywhere! <- it is on the top level!
2. private -> visible only in the class, where it was declared! (including of its subclasses!)
3. protected -> visible anywhere in its own package! but also in subclasses even if they are in another package!
4. package private -  default (no keyword required) -> the object is visible only in its own package
(but not to classes in external packages!) <- it is on the top level in the package!
